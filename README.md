# ActionCameraCode
code examples and utilities for ART350 ActionCameraCode at University of Buffalo, Spring 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
This course is an introduction to computational thinking in code combined with an overview of great video art. Students are exposed to the opportunities of time based image capture along two vectors. First, with repeated field experiments with GoPro cameras. Second with exposure to film/video classics where camera handling played an important role, including Dziga Vertov's 'Man with a Move Camera' 1929, Luis Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' 1929, Chris Marker's 'La Jetée' 1962, Michael Snow's 'La Région Centrale' 1971, Douglas Gordon's 'Psycho' 1993, Pipilotti Rist's 'Ever is overall' 1997 and others. 

After several weeks of image capture and screenings, the course moves to coding, on an introductory level in python (3). Technically, the functions offered below are nothing more than wrappers of ffmpeg funcionalities. But they allow coding novices to concentrate on processing video and spending less time on setting sometimes arcane flags and conditions.

While many programming ideas are not covered in this course, those that do pertain to video management are adequately addressed, and contextualized in code development such that beginners can use the code examples developed here to perform computationally based video experiments on their own.
